Good day, dear marker,

=RUNNING CODE=
The code is written in python, but in the format of a Jupyter notebook.
Jupyter notebook installation instructions can be found here: http://technivore.org/posts/2016/02/27/windows-jupyter-three-ways.html
Each notebook is independent from the other.
To run the notebook, simply click 'cell'> 'run cells'

=PRINTED CODE=
Alternatively, I've printed the code in pdf form for your viewing pleasure.

=DEPENDENCIES=
Multiprocessing library was used to exploit all processor cores.
Seaborn library was used to prettify plots but is not ncessary.

=REMARKS=
This work deserves an A, read it and be convinced!
Feel free to contact me if you have further questions.
